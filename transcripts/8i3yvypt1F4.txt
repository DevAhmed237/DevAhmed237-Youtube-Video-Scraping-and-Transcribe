0.0:  So Google recently made a massive update to its BARD chat bot,
3.72:  which makes it so much more useful.
5.76:  And although I'm recording this video when the news is only a few hours old,
9.28:  there's already people on X sharing cool ways to use these new features
14.24:  inside of BARD. So let's dig in.
16.4:  So the biggest update that they announced was that they're launching BARD
19.36:  extensions in English.
21.2:  BARD can now find and show relevant information from Google tools like Gmail,
25.3:  Docs, Drive, Google Maps, YouTube, Google flights, and hotels.
29.16:  And it will even combine information across multiple sources with its responses.
33.92:  It says here that if you choose to use the workspace extensions,
36.72:  your content from Gmail Docs and Drive is not seen by human reviewers used by
41.64:  BARD to show you ads or used to train the BARD model.
45.28:  They also added the feature to easily double check the responses that BARD
49.08:  shared with you. So when you get a response,
51.72:  it will highlight the things in green that Google search was able to confirm,
55.76:  and it will highlight in sort of this yellow orangey color,
59.0:  the things that Google found conflicting information around.
62.56:  You can now also share conversations that you had in BARD with other people.
66.48:  And when they get the link to that conversation that you already had,
69.72:  they're able to then continue the conversation and use your existing
73.32:  conversation as a starting point.
74.92:  So let's go ahead and jump right into BARD and play around with some of this,
78.28:  as well as test some of the cool use cases that other people have shared over on
82.36:  X.
82.84:  So one thing to note is these extensions only work on the non Google workspace
87.08:  accounts.
87.76:  I normally use Google with my mattwolf.com Google workspace account,
92.28:  but in order to get this to work, these new extension features,
95.28:  I actually had to use one of my older Gmail accounts to actually see the
99.0:  extensions. So if you are on one of the Google workspace accounts,
101.64:  it doesn't seem that these features are in there quite yet.
104.2:  So when I first log in, I get this pop-up here, introducing BARD extensions,
108.24:  BARD meets Google workspace, quickly get what you need from Gmail,
111.88:  get summaries of content from documents and PDFs.
114.48:  Google respects your privacy, double check BARD's response.
117.8:  This is all stuff that was in that news release that we just looked at and we
121.24:  are in BARD. And I noticed there's a little puzzle piece image up here.
125.48:  It says extensions. Let's go ahead and click on this. And it says,
128.32:  extend your reach. BARD's extensions can now access information from YouTube,
131.6:  maps, flights, and hotels to save time, create plan and more.
134.8:  So let's go ahead and click. Let's go. So by default, it turned on Google flights,
138.68:  Google hotels, Google maps, and YouTube.
141.84:  Let's go ahead and turn on Google workspace as well,
144.2:  to be able to search within Gmail drive and docs.
147.56:  It asked me to connect to Google workspace. So let's go ahead and do it.
150.72:  And we should be good to go on our extensions.
154.12:  Now we'll click back to new chat and the two people that I've come across today
158.24:  that have shared some really interesting use cases for this new BARD have been
162.36:  my good friend, Chris Cashtenova over here on X as well as Paul Couvert over here
166.72:  on X.
167.32:  So I'm going to use some of their examples and test some of the ideas that they
171.6:  shared. Now, some of the ideas that Chris shared are from September 8th,
175.28:  which is actually before this extensions release for BARD,
179.16:  but there are things that I haven't tried yet.
180.72:  So I'm going to try some things that seemingly worked pretty well inside of
185.0:  BARD, even before this extensions release, for example,
187.68:  Chris shared that you can actually submit a meme into Google BARD and BARD
192.56:  will actually help you understand the meaning of that meme.
196.32:  So if you come across something, it just feels totally over your head,
199.44:  throw it into BARD and see what happens.
201.16:  So I came across this meme of Kermit the frog.
203.88:  Let's go ahead and toss it into BARD and see what BARD thinks of it.
207.6:  Just drag and drop the image right here into the chat box.
210.56:  Explain why this meme is funny.
213.84:  The meme is funny because it is relatable to many people.
216.84:  Kermit the frog is a character from the Muppets and he is often seen as a symbol
220.24:  of boredom and procrastination.
221.68:  The image captures the feeling of putting off a task until the last minute and
224.52:  then having to wait even longer because you're not quite ready to start yet.
227.4:  If you want, you can pause the video and read the rest of the
229.44:  explanation, but it's pretty good.
230.88:  Now there's this G button down here that says double check response.
233.68:  If I click on that, it'll search Google, evaluate BARD statements,
237.24:  and this one found no results.
239.64:  So this wasn't actually based on any sort of search.
242.96:  It just interpreted the picture.
244.88:  Chris also recommends BARD for DIY type stuff.
248.04:  For instance, uploading a food item or something like socks, and then asking
253.08:  BARD how to recreate that.
254.76:  So for instance, here's an image of a cheeseburger.
256.8:  Let's see what happens if I upload it and ask it to give me a recipe.
260.04:  Toss it in here.
260.92:  How can I recreate this food?
262.6:  To recreate the triple cheeseburger in the image, you will
264.84:  need the following ingredients.
266.2:  Three hamburger patties, three slices of American cheese.
268.56:  I actually think it's a double cheeseburger, but I'll let that slide.
270.8:  One sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise.
273.88:  And then it goes on to give me the instructions on how to cook it.
276.72:  And there we go.
277.8:  Let's go ahead and double check the response from Google.
280.4:  You can see that it highlighted three slices of American cheese.
282.88:  If I click over that, it actually found some similar content on Reddit.
286.04:  If I click over, there are many different types of cheese that
288.36:  work well on cheeseburgers.
289.48:  Click on that.
290.2:  It found a website food and wine that it got that information from.
293.84:  And then there's some related topics down here.
295.72:  How to make a triple cheeseburger.
297.0:  What are the ingredients in a triple burger?
298.88:  What's in a triple cheeseburger?
300.8:  I really think that's a double cheeseburger, but other than the three meat patties
304.28:  part, I think it got the ingredients pretty dang right in this same thread.
307.68:  Chris also goes on to say that BARD is really good at improving things like
312.16:  images, you can give it an image and that will actually give you an improved
315.6:  prompt to go and reprompt that image as well as with code.
319.16:  It's not amazing at writing code right from scratch, but it's
322.6:  really good at improving code.
324.4:  So if you give it code and ask it to critique or improve that code,
327.92:  BARD is really good at that.
329.04:  But let's talk about some of the features that are new that they just added.
332.48:  Let's jump over to this thread from Paul Couvert here, where he suggests BARD
336.64:  can now summarize your Gmail emails.
338.8:  You can also access your Google docs, slides, and sheets.
342.0:  So let's have it summarize something from my email inbox.
346.04:  Let's try a prompt.
346.76:  Like what are the recent updates from my kid's school in my email?
349.88:  Here's some recent updates from your kid's school in your email.
352.2:  You belong week is coming up on September 18th through 22nd.
355.08:  The PTA is having a membership drive.
357.0:  Roundup tickets are on sale now.
358.68:  Heartland swimming association.
359.88:  Aqua fest is on October 17.
362.32:  There are several community organizations offering enrichment opportunities for
365.48:  kids, and then it actually points me to some of the emails that were used for
370.76:  this response that it gave me.
372.4:  So it just searched directly in my email for all the announcements from my kid's
375.6:  school, as well as the swim team that my daughter's on part is also good
378.76:  at helping you find flights.
380.24:  So for example, what are the cheapest flights with no stops from
382.84:  San Diego to Maui in October?
384.76:  Searching Google flights.
386.04:  I found a few round trip flights with no stops from San Diego to Maui
389.52:  departing October 4th and returning on October 6th.
392.16:  I mean, that's way too short of a trip for Maui, but at least we
394.88:  got one of the directions, Alaska airlines, Hawaiian airlines.
399.28:  Damn, only 237 bucks round trip.
401.64:  I mean, that's really not that bad, but again, who would go to Maui and
404.56:  leave on the 4th and come back on the 6th?
406.08:  That's just ludicrous and also find places on Google maps for you.
409.48:  So for example, if I type, I'm going to be in the lower east side of
411.88:  New York next week, what are the highest rated pizza places in the area?
415.52:  It's going to search Google maps for me.
417.08:  Here's some of the highest rated pizza places in lower east side of New
419.68:  York, according to Google maps, Salugi's pizza, uncle Sam's pizza, Alfonso's
423.96:  pizzeria, Scar's pizza and slice joint.
426.8:  If you know the lower east side of New York, you can confirm or deny these
430.44:  results.
431.08:  Chris Cascianova points out that you can also have it book hotels for you.
434.52:  Help me book a hotel in the lower east side of New York next week.
437.52:  Here are some highly rated hotels in the lower east side of New York.
440.6:  Double tree, Holiday Inn, Hotel Indigo, Madison less hotel.
445.12:  Book the holiday in for me.
446.92:  All right.
447.16:  So I need the following information.
448.68:  Check in and check out date, number of guests, room type.
451.24:  Let's do check in next Wednesday.
452.84:  Check out on Friday.
454.28:  One guest King bed.
455.4:  Now you can see it's using Google hotels and it gives me the links directly to
459.28:  where I can book along with images from each of the hotels, the prices for the
463.36:  hotels.
464.2:  I could click on the holiday and express here and it'll take me to where I can
467.48:  actually book the hotel.
468.76:  Then if I ask it a question like what are some interesting facts about the James
472.16:  Webb telescope, you can see it pulls up all these facts, but once again, I want
476.64:  to confirm these facts.
477.72:  So let's click on double check response.
479.76:  It's going to search Google for me and you can see it highlighted in this sort
482.92:  of greenish color.
483.84:  It's a little bit hard to see cause I use dark mode.
485.88:  The green and the Brown would sound a little bit better if I was using light
488.56:  mode, but you could see the ones in green.
490.76:  It confirmed on NASA's website here.
493.76:  This one's confirmed by NASA, by the web telescope.org.
497.48:  So you can actually see where it confirmed this information, James Webb
500.92:  discovery, web telescope.org.
503.64:  And then down here, this Brown one, the JWST is so sensitive that it can detect
508.12:  the heat signature of a B from a distance of 24 miles away.
511.48:  If I click on that one, Google search, didn't find relevant content.
514.84:  Consider researching further to assess the statement.
517.28:  So it's basically telling me here's a fact about it, but I'm not totally sure.
521.04:  And then it gives me some related searches that will search Google for me.
524.6:  Now, if I actually want to share this chat thread and let somebody else
527.08:  review my chat or even continue where I left off on the chat, I can click this
530.92:  button that says share and export, click share and create a public link.
534.96:  Here's the public link.
535.92:  Anybody can use it.
536.8:  If I copy this, let's go ahead and open it in a new incognito window here.
540.64:  Paste that in and you can see here's my chat that I just had.
544.48:  And then I can actually continue this chat if I was to then
547.48:  sign in and click continue.
549.48:  So these are some really amazing new features that are in Bard.
552.32:  A couple other pieces of information about Bard.
554.64:  It has not moved over to the new Gemini model, which is supposed to be so much
558.76:  larger than Palm two and GPT four.
561.84:  But right now it's still using the Palm two model from Google.
565.32:  As of right now, it's one of the few chat bots that will actually search the web
570.16:  to pull up as up-to-date relevant information as possible right now.
573.96:  You can't do that with chat GPT.
575.72:  You can't do that with Anthropics.
577.04:  Claude perplexity will do that.
579.08:  But as of right now, I think Bard is the best at doing that.
582.32:  And even the way it fact checks itself helps you make sure that the information
585.92:  that you're getting from it is actually relevant and legit information that you
590.4:  can feel comfortable sharing because it's helping cite the source and you can click
594.88:  right over to the source and find where the information was shared and not
600.12:  only does it share the link to the source.
602.4:  If I click on the source, it will actually highlight the section of that
606.24:  page for me where it found that information.
609.4:  So I don't have to go through and read the whole article to find how it found
613.56:  that it just points it right to me.
615.4:  Also, unlike chat GPT and unlike Claude, there is no pro plan for this.
619.68:  You can just use it.
620.64:  It's freely available to Google users right now.
623.8:  Again, it's not available yet on the upgraded workspace plans, but if you just
627.28:  have a regular Google Gmail free account with Google drive and that sort of stuff,
632.16:  you can use this right now.
633.64:  You can get the extensions and it connects to all of your tools.
637.12:  I want to do one more experiment here.
638.88:  That's not based on anything I've seen on X or anything like that.
641.92:  I'm just curious how well it works with sheets.
644.56:  So one last experiment before we wrap up here, what was my
647.4:  latest Google sheets spreadsheet?
649.36:  It's looking in Google workspace.
650.96:  Now it pulled up some documents.
653.2:  These aren't necessarily.
655.08:  Sheets.
655.8:  Let's go ahead and reword it.
657.28:  What was my latest spreadsheet?
658.8:  See if it can sort down to just the spreadsheets.
661.16:  So it's struggling a little to find just the spreadsheets.
664.48:  It's finding docs for me, but not specifically the Google sheets for me.
669.28:  But just for fun, let's go ahead and say, give me a short step by step of the
673.12:  process in hustle and flow chart podcast process.
676.48:  Let's see if it'll actually break out the steps for me here.
678.76:  Record the episode, add episode to Dropbox, edit slash clean up audio file, put it in
683.08:  completed folder, right?
684.04:  Show notes, create featured image, upload to Libsyn bed player on WordPress
688.04:  mail list when show goes live.
689.92:  So there you go.
691.12:  It actually looked inside of this document for me and then broke down the process.
695.72:  If I open up the actual document, you could see it's a much longer
698.4:  document with a lot more steps.
699.84:  It just gave me the overview of it.
702.08:  So I'll definitely be putting Bard through its motions and
704.36:  testing it more and more.
705.48:  And as I come across new, cool use cases for it, I plan to do another
709.44:  Bard update in the future to show you all the cool ways that I've come
712.56:  across that you can use it.
713.76:  But for right now, I wanted to give you an update, let you know that these
716.16:  new Bard features exist and give you the opportunity to go jump in and play
719.84:  around with them yourself, because they're pretty cool from a usefulness
723.08:  perspective, Bard is definitely catching up with chat GPT and Claude, because
726.88:  right now it's the best one at actually using your data as well as searching
732.32:  the internet for additional information and context.
735.04:  So you can check it out, bard.google.com.
737.8:  And if you want to make sure you stay in the loop with all of the latest cool
741.68:  AI tools, as well as AI news, check out future tools.io.
745.72:  I recently just added a dark mode here, which was one of my most requested
749.56:  features, so check that out.
751.48:  Maybe it'll make you want to use the site more so it doesn't make your eyes burn.
754.12:  I don't know, but I keep it up to date almost every single day with all the
756.8:  latest tools and latest news in the AI space.
759.68:  And if you like videos like this, you want to stay up to date on the latest
762.72:  news in the AI space, as well as get cool tutorials on how to do stuff,
766.52:  see some fun AI challenges and learn about new tools all the time.
770.84:  Make sure you subscribe to this channel and like videos like this, and it'll
773.48:  make sure more show up in your YouTube feed and it also helps me out.
777.0:  It makes me feel good.
777.92:  So thank you so much for tuning into this video.
780.2:  I really, really appreciate you.
781.52:  I'll see you guys in the next one.
782.68:  Bye bye.
