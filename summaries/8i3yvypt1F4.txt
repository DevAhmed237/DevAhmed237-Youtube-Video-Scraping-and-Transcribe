Google has made significant improvements to its BARD chatbot, making it more practical and more powerful than ever before. The standout update is the addition of BARD extensions in English, a feature that pulls real-time data from Google tools. Now, BARD can locate and display relevant details from Gmail, Docs, Drive, Google Maps, YouTube, Google flights, and hotels. It can also combine this detail across multiple sources to provide more comprehensive responses.

An important note: while using workspace extensions, any content from Gmail, Docs, Drive is not available to human reviewers who work with BARD. This data is neither used for the display of ads, nor is it reapplied to train the BARD model - thereby protecting your privacy.

Additional features include the ability to easily verify the responses generated by BARD. Once it provides a response, the bot underlines the information in green that Google's search engine has confirmed and items in a yellowish-orange color which have contradicting details available on Google. Moreover, you can now share BARD conversations with other individuals, who can then continue the chat or use it as a starting point for their own.

However, these extensions are solely available on non-Google workspace accounts at the moment. Standard Gmail account holders will be able to reap the benefits of these new extension abilities.

During initial usage, you'll be introduced to a pop-up discussing BARD extensions, such as BARD meets Google Workspace and Google's respect for your privacy. The homepage has a small puzzle-like image in a corner indicating extensions. Here, extensions like Google Flights, Google Hotels, Google Maps, and YouTube are switched on by default. You can also allow access to Gmail, Drive, and Docs by toggling Google Workspace on.

BARD can show you diverse ways to use these tools for personal advantage. For instance, it can summarize Gmail emails, provide accessible information from Google Docs, Slides, and Sheets, name the highest-rated pizza places in a particular area, find the cheapest flights, and help book hotels according to your requirements. It can even summarize relevant details from your emails, such as recent updates from your child's school.

Additionally, BARD is adept at locating flights. An example is querying the cheapest non-stop flights from one location to another. BARD then accesses Google Flights to retrieve a list of round-trip options. You can also ask him to find places on Google Maps. 

Further capabilities include its ability to book hotels. By asking BARD to help book a hotel in a particular area during a certain period, it retrieves a list of highly rated hotels. To make a booking, it seeks further information such as check-in and check-out dates, the number of guests, and the room type.

One fun experiment is to ask BARD to present interesting facts about a particular topic of interest, for example, the James Webb telescope. The bot then provides a host of facts, which you can fact-check by selecting "double check response." The bot then searches for these facts on Google and highlights confirmed details in green and unverified details in brown.

Despite being based on Palm two model from Google - and not the newer Gemini model - BARD remains a powerful chatbot in terms of its ability to access real-time data from the web and provide relevant and accurate information. Additionally, Google has not currently offered a pro plan for Bard, meaning it's freely available to all Google users. You can explore BARD and test its capabilities for yourself at bard.google.com.
